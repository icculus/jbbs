So this was something I messed around with for a few days
and gave up on, and then found a few years later and
stuffed into CVS (then Subversion, then Mercurial...).

I was feeling nostalgic for old dial-up BBSes, and thought
it would be fun to write one, presumably to connect to with
telnet, in Java. I have strange ideas of fun, I guess.

Anyhow, I didn't get very far on it, and probably made a
lot of rookie mistakes even in what's here, but it's mine
and I'll keep it here for memory's sake.

Don't send patches.  :)
